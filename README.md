# üåç Travel Planner Agentic Application

## Overview

The **Travel Planner Agentic Application** is an AI-powered travel assistant and expense planner. It helps users plan trips to any destination worldwide by leveraging real-time data and advanced language models. The application provides:

- **Comprehensive, day-by-day travel itineraries**
- **Recommendations for hotels, restaurants, attractions, and activities**
- **Detailed cost breakdowns and per-day expense budgets**
- **Weather information and transportation options**
- **Two travel plans:** one for popular tourist spots and another for off-beat locations

The backend is built with **FastAPI**, and the frontend uses **Streamlit** for an interactive chat-based experience.
